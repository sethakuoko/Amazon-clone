# Amazon Clone ProjectðŸ’»ðŸš€

## Overview

This project is a basic home page clone of Amazon.com, created as a part of my CSS and HTML learning journey. It serves as a demonstration of my understanding of front-end development using these technologies. Please note that this is a static demo page, and certain features such as links and buttons are non-functional.


## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file representing the home page.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file containing the styles for the page.
## Important Note

- **Functionality**: This is a static demo, and features like links and buttons are not operational.
- **Completeness**: Due to the enormity of the actual Amazon website, this clone is a basic representation, and some elements may be missing.
- **Ongoing Development**: This project is a work in progress, and enhancements will be made over time to improve its functionality and completeness.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the project by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. Since this is a static representation, you won't be able to perform actual transactions or navigate to other pages as you would on the official Amazon website.
## Future Development

I plan to enhance this project by implementing additional features, improving the user interface, and making it more interactive. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to develop and refine this Amazon clone.
